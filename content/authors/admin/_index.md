I am in incoming PhD student in Neuroscience at Columbia. I currently work with [Scott Linderman](https://web.stanford.edu/~swl1/) and [Krishna Shenoy](https://shenoy.people.stanford.edu/krishna-shenoy) developing dynamical systems models for neuroscience data. Building websites is, sadly, not one of my talents.
